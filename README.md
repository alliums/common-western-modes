### common-western-modes
A simple selection of the absolute most fundamental Western musical modes in Scala scale (.scl) format.
Currently has the 7 diatonic modes and 1 pentatonic scale.

### contents
the 7 diatonic modes:
1. Lydian
2. Ionian
3. Mixolydian
4. Dorian
5. Aeolian
6. Phrygian
7. Locrian
8. The pythagorean pentatonic scale

### project status
this project is still under development. I plan to expand this pack with a few more fundamental scales, but these are the most important.
these may have minor inaccuracies in tuning. I plan to scrutinize these much more heavily in the future, and ensure that the ratios are optimized.

### credits
ratios for the diatonics from [Bruce Olson](https://web.archive.org/web/20210801000000*/https://www.csufresno.edu/folklore/Olson/JUSTINT.HTM). Thank you, Dr. Olson.

more modes in the same format available on my github.

### NOTE (9/17/2024)
I have not touched this project in a few years, but I intend to flesh it out in the future. Credit to [embeddedsystemred](https://github.com/embeddedsystemred) for forking the repository and adding chromatic scales. I will add this fork to the main branch eventually, hopefully along with some more stuff.
