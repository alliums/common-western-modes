### common-western-modes
A simple selection of the absolute most fundamental Western musical modes.
Currently has the 7 diatonic modes and 1 pentatonic scale.

### contents
the 7 diatonic modes:
1. Lydian
2. Ionian
3. Mixolydian
4. Dorian
5. Aeolian
6. Phrygian
7. Locrian

8. The pythagorean pentatonic scale

### project status
this project is still under development. I plan to expand this pack with a few more fundamental scales, but these are the most important.
these may have minor inaccuracies in tuning. I plan to scrutinize these much more heavily in the future, and ensure that the ratios are optimized.
